In Terraform, .tfvars and .auto.tfvars files are used to define variable values for configurations, making it easier to manage and automate deployments. Hereâ€™s how they differ:

1. <filename>.tfvars:

This file contains variable values and is manually specified in the terraform apply or terraform plan command.

For example, you could create a file called dev.tfvars for development-specific values and provide it using terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars".



2. <filename>.auto.tfvars:

Any file ending in .auto.tfvars is automatically loaded by Terraform, so you don't need to specify it in the command.

These files are helpful for setting default variable values that Terraform will apply automatically without additional command-line arguments.




Use Cases:

Environment-Specific Configurations: For multiple environments (like dev, staging, and prod), you can use .tfvars files for each environment, naming them accordingly (e.g., dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars).

Automatic Loading of Defaults: Use .auto.tfvars files to store default configurations that apply across all environments unless explicitly overridden by other .tfvars files.
