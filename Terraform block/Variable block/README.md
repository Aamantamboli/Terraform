In Terraform, a **variable block** is used to define input variables for a configuration. These variables allow you to make your Terraform configuration flexible and reusable by parameterizing values that can change based on the environment or use case. Rather than hardcoding values directly in the configuration, you define variables and provide values for them when you run Terraform.

### Syntax of a Variable Block

Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of a `variable` block:

```hcl
variable "variable_name" {
  description = "A short description of what this variable is for"
  type        = string  # Can be string, number, bool, list, map, etc.
  default     = "default_value"  # Optional default value
  sensitive   = true  # Optional flag to mark the variable as sensitive (e.g., for secrets)
}
```
### Key Features of Variables in Terraform:

1. **`description`**: Provides an optional description to explain the purpose of the variable.
2. **`type`**: Specifies the expected type of the variable. Terraform supports various types like `string`, `number`, `bool`, `list`, `map`, `set`, etc.
3. **`default`**: This is an optional value that provides a default if no value is provided during plan or apply. If no default is provided, Terraform requires the variable to be set explicitly.
4. **`sensitive`**: If set to `true`, the value of the variable will be hidden in logs and outputs, which is useful for sensitive data like passwords or API keys.


### Conclusion:
In summary, variable blocks in Terraform provide a way to define parameters that can be reused and customized when deploying infrastructure. By using variables, you can make your Terraform configurations more modular and portable across different environments, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
